# Tests

This directory contains the tests for the basic functionality of this library. I initially wanted this to simply test out that all my classes/functions are doing their jobs as intended. Maybe I can later add some integration tests, I don't know...

## `data/`

The `data/` directory contains some input files to the tests.

Here is a list of the input files and their descriptions:

- `square.mglyph` - a file containing a single exported glyph; useful for checking if my library code successfully parses the zip and exports the right data
